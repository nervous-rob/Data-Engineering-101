### What is Data Engineering?
Data engineering is the practice of designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure and systems that collect, process, store, and analyze data at scale. Data engineers are responsible for:

- Building and maintaining data pipelines
- Ensuring data quality and reliability
- Optimizing data storage and retrieval
- Implementing data security and governance

### Role in the Data Ecosystem
Data engineering serves as the foundation for:
- Data science and machine learning
- Business intelligence and analytics
- Data-driven decision making
- Real-time data processing

### Evolution of Data Engineering
1. Traditional ETL Era
   - Batch processing
   - On-premise systems
   - Structured data focus

2. Big Data Era
   - Distributed computing

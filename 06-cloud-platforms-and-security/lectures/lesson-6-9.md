### 3. Exam Preparation Best Practices

📚 **Study Materials Organization**:
```python
class CertificationPrep:
    """Manages certification preparation resources and progress"""
    def __init__(self, certification_path: str):
        self.path = certification_path
        self.progress = {}
        self.resources = self._initialize_resources()
        
    def _initialize_resources(self) -> Dict[str, List[str]]:
        """Set up study resources by topic"""
        return {
            "official_docs": [],
            "practice_tests": [],
            "video_courses": [],
            "hands_on_labs": [],
            "study_guides": []
        }
        
    def track_progress(self, topic: str, status: float) -> None:
        """Track study progress by topic"""
        self.progress[topic] = status
        
    def generate_study_plan(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Create personalized study plan"""
        return {
            "daily_goals": self._set_daily_goals(),
            "weekly_milestones": self._set_weekly_milestones(),
            "practice_schedule": self._create_practice_schedule()
        }
```

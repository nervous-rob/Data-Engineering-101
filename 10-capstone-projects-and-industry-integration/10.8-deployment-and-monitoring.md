## Practice Areas

### Deployment Setup
1. CI/CD pipeline
2. Deployment automation
3. Environment configuration
4. Validation checks
5. Rollback procedures

### Monitoring Implementation
1. Metrics collection
2. Alert configuration
3. Log management
4. Dashboard creation
5. Health checks

## Implementation Tips

### Best Practices

## Configuration Examples

### AWS S3 Bucket Configuration
```yaml
Resources:
  DataBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: my-data-bucket
      VersioningConfiguration:
        Status: Enabled
      PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
        BlockPublicAcls: true
        BlockPublicPolicy: true
        IgnorePublicAcls: true
        RestrictPublicBuckets: true
      CorsConfiguration:
        CorsRules:
          - AllowedHeaders: ['*']
            AllowedMethods: [GET, PUT, POST, DELETE]
            AllowedOrigins: ['https://my-domain.com']
            MaxAge: 3000
```

### Azure Storage Account Configuration
```yaml
resources:
  - type: Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
    name: mystorageaccount
    location: eastus
    properties:
      accountType: Standard_LRS
      supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: true
      minimumTlsVersion: TLS1_2
      networkAcls:
        defaultAction: Deny
        virtualNetworkRules:
          - virtualNetworkResourceId: /subscriptions/subscription-id/resourceGroups/rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet
            action: Allow
```

## Best Practices

### Cloud Architecture Design
1. **High Availability**
   - Implement multi-region deployments
   - Use auto-scaling groups
   - Design for fault tolerance
   - Implement proper load balancing

2. **Security**
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Implement proper IAM roles
   - Use encryption at rest and in transit
   - Regular security audits

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Right-size resources
   - Use reserved instances
   - Implement auto-scaling
   - Monitor and optimize storage

4. **Performance**
   - Use CDN for static content
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Optimize database queries
   - Use appropriate instance types

## Real-World Case Studies

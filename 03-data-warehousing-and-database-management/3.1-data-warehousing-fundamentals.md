## Content

### Data Warehouse Architecture

#### Core Components
- Data sources
- Staging area
- Data warehouse storage
- Data marts
- Metadata repository

#### Architectural Patterns
- Hub and spoke
- Data vault
- Kimball's dimensional model
- Inmon's enterprise warehouse

### ETL vs. ELT

#### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Traditional approach
- Data transformation before loading
- Resource requirements
- Use cases
- Tools and technologies

#### ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)
- Modern approach
- In-database transformation
- Cloud advantages
- Use cases
- Tools and technologies

### OLAP vs. OLTP

#### OLAP Systems
- Analytical processing
- Historical data analysis
- Complex queries
- Aggregated data
- Performance optimization

#### OLTP Systems
- Transactional processing
- Real-time operations
- Simple queries
- Detailed data
- Consistency requirements

## Activities

### Activity 1: Architecture Design
Design a data warehouse architecture:
1. Identify requirements
2. Choose architecture pattern
3. Define components
4. Document design decisions

### Activity 2: ETL vs. ELT Analysis
Compare approaches for a given scenario:
1. Analyze requirements
2. Evaluate approaches
3. Make recommendations
4. Document rationale

## Best Practices

### Design Principles

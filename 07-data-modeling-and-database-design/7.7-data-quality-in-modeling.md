## Configuration Examples

### Quality Rules Configuration
```yaml
quality_rules:
  dataset: customer_data
  rules:
    - name: completeness_check
      type: completeness
      columns:
        - customer_id
        - email
        - name
      threshold: 99.9%
      action: alert
    
    - name: uniqueness_check
      type: uniqueness
      columns:
        - customer_id
        - email
      threshold: 100%
      action: fail
    
    - name: format_check
      type: format
      column: email
      pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
      action: warn
    
    - name: range_check
      type: range
      column: age
      min: 18
      max: 100
      action: alert
```

### Quality Monitoring Setup
```yaml
quality_monitoring:
  name: customer_data_quality
  schedule: "0 */4 * * *"
  metrics:
    - name: completeness
      type: percentage
      threshold: 99.9%
      window: 24h
    - name: accuracy
      type: percentage
      threshold: 99.5%
      window: 24h
    - name: freshness
      type: timestamp
      threshold: 1h
      window: 24h
  
  alerts:
    - name: quality_alert
      type: email
      recipients:
        - data_team@company.com
      conditions:
        - metric: completeness
          operator: less_than
          value: 99.9%
        - metric: accuracy
          operator: less_than
          value: 99.5%
```

## Best Practices

### Quality Implementation Guidelines
1. **Assessment**
   - Regular profiling
   - Metric tracking
   - Trend analysis
   - Root cause analysis

2. **Validation**
   - Clear rules
   - Proper thresholds
   - Action definitions
   - Error handling

3. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time checks
   - Automated alerts
   - Performance tracking
   - Resource management

4. **Improvement**
   - Regular reviews
   - Rule updates
   - Process optimization
   - Team training

## Practice Problems

### Basic to Intermediate
1. URL shortener design
2. Rate limiter implementation
3. Key-value store design
4. Chat application architecture
5. File storage system

### Advanced
1. Distributed cache system
2. Real-time analytics platform
3. Social media feed system
4. Payment processing system
5. Search engine architecture

## Interview Tips

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. Gather requirements
2. Define system scope
3. Design high-level architecture
4. Dive into components
5. Discuss trade-offs
6. Consider scaling

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Over-engineering solutions
- Ignoring non-functional requirements
- Missing important components
- Not considering failure scenarios
- Poor communication of design decisions

## Resources

### Online Platforms

```

### Domain Model Example
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Bank {
        +String bankId
        +String name
        +String address
        +addAccount()
        +removeAccount()
    }
    class Account {
        +String accountId
        +String accountType
        +Decimal balance
        +deposit()
        +withdraw()
        +transfer()
    }
    class Customer {
        +String customerId
        +String name
        +String email
        +openAccount()
        +closeAccount()
    }
    Bank "1" -- "*" Account
    Customer "1" -- "*" Account
```

## Configuration Examples

### Business Entity Definition
```yaml
business_entity:
  name: Bank
  description: "Financial institution"
  attributes:
    - name: bankId
      type: string
      description: "Unique identifier"
      business_rules:
        - "Must be unique"
        - "Format: BNK-XXXXX"
    - name: name
      type: string
      description: "Bank name"
      business_rules:
        - "Required"
        - "Max length: 100"
  relationships:
    - type: one_to_many
      target: Account
      description: "Bank holds accounts"
      business_rules:
        - "Bank must have at least one account"
        - "Account must belong to one bank"
```

### Business Rule Definition
```yaml
business_rule:
  name: account_balance_rule
  description: "Account balance cannot be negative"
  type: validation
  scope: Account
  condition: balance >= 0
  actions:
    - type: prevent
      message: "Account balance cannot be negative"
    - type: notify
      target: "account_holder"
      message: "Your account balance is low"
  exceptions:
    - type: overdraft
      condition: has_overdraft_protection
```

## Best Practices

### Conceptual Modeling Guidelines
1. **Business Analysis**
   - Clear requirements
   - Stakeholder input
   - Domain expertise
   - Use case validation

2. **Entity Design**
   - Clear boundaries
   - Proper abstraction
   - Business relevance
   - Future extensibility

3. **Relationship Design**
   - Clear semantics
   - Proper cardinality
   - Business rules
   - Integrity constraints

4. **Documentation**
   - Business context
   - Domain rules
   - Assumptions
   - Constraints

## Real-World Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Banking System Model
- **Challenge**: Design banking system conceptual model
- **Solution**:
  - Core banking entities
  - Transaction relationships
  - Business rules
  - Process flows
- **Results**:
  - Clear domain model
  - Well-defined rules
  - Scalable structure
  - Maintainable design

### Case Study 2: Healthcare System Model
- **Challenge**: Design healthcare system conceptual model
- **Solution**:
  - Patient care entities
  - Clinical relationships
  - Medical rules
  - Care processes
- **Results**:
  - Patient-centric model
  - Clinical accuracy
  - Regulatory compliance
  - Care quality

## Common Pitfalls
- Over-complex models
- Missing business rules
- Poor abstraction
- Incomplete requirements
- Insufficient validation

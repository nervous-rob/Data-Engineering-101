## Practice Areas

### Project Setup
1. Requirements documentation
2. Architecture diagrams
3. Timeline creation
4. Resource planning
5. Risk assessment

### Design Activities
1. System component mapping
2. Data flow documentation
3. Integration planning
4. Security considerations
5. Performance optimization

## Planning Tips

### Best Practices
1. Start with clear objectives
2. Document all requirements
3. Create detailed timelines
4. Identify key stakeholders
5. Plan for contingencies
6. Regular progress tracking

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Unclear requirements
- Incomplete scope definition
- Unrealistic timelines
- Missing dependencies
- Poor resource allocation

## Resources

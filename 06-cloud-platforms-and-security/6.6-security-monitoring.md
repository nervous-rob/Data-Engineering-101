## Configuration Examples

### SIEM Configuration
```yaml
siem:
  collection:
    sources:
      - type: syslog
        format: rfc5424
        retention: 90_days
      - type: windows_event
        format: evtx
        retention: 90_days
      - type: application_log
        format: json
        retention: 90_days
  processing:
    correlation:
      rules:
        - name: failed_login
          threshold: 5
          timeframe: 5_minutes
        - name: suspicious_activity
          threshold: 3
          timeframe: 1_hour
    alerts:
      severity_levels:
        - critical
        - high
        - medium
        - low
```

### Monitoring Dashboard Configuration
```yaml
dashboard:
  security_overview:
    metrics:
      - name: threat_detection
        type: gauge
        threshold: 95%
      - name: incident_response
        type: gauge
        threshold: 90%
      - name: system_health
        type: gauge
        threshold: 98%
  alerts:
    display:
      - severity
      - source
      - timestamp
      - status
    actions:
      - notify
      - escalate
      - remediate
```
